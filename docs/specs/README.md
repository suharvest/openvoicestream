## Kokoro RK (Radxa / RK3588) — TTS NPU optimization

Workstream goal: get the Kokoro v1.0 TTS to a viable RTF and TTFA on
RK3588 NPU. Final shipped state (2026-05-23): 34 % NPU residency
(decoder-front INT8 + vocoder front-half FP16), 4-stage pipeline with a
3-bucket dynamic router (seq_len 8 / 16 / 32) and misaki ZH G2P. HTTP RTF
0.59, short-EN TTFA 0.79 s, mid TTFA 1.6 s.
