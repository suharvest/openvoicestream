"""Boot-time integration seam for leaf compositions (TRACK 1 SLICE 2 — gated).

This is the thin glue that wires :mod:`server.core.leaf_composition` (a pure,
standalone resolver shipped in SLICE 1) into the server startup sequence —
*gated* behind an optional ``composition`` profile key. A profile WITHOUT a
``composition`` block takes no new code path: every existing (flat) profile is
byte-for-byte unchanged and no profile is migrated in this slice.

When a profile DOES carry a ``composition`` block::

    "composition": {
        "device":   "orin-nx",
        "asr":      "asr.qwen3_asr.orin-nx.n2",
        "tts":      "tts.qwen3_tts.orin-nx.n2",
        "vad":      "...",            # optional, treated like any other leaf id
        "overrides": {"K": "V"}       # optional env overrides (leaf < override)
    }

:func:`apply_composition` then, in order:

  1. ``load_registry()`` — read the on-disk leaf/device/model registry.
  2. ``validate_composition(device, [leaf ids])`` — fail fast on a bad
     composition (unknown/unbuilt leaf, illegal capability pairing, memory over
     budget). The error propagates so boot ABORTS with a clear message.
  3. ``resolve_env(selected, overrides)`` — merge ``leaf < overrides`` and apply
     the result to ``os.environ`` with the system's env precedence: an env var
     ALREADY present in ``os.environ`` WINS over the leaf-derived value (i.e.
     we only set keys that are not already there — ``setdefault`` semantics,
     mirroring how :mod:`server.core.profile_loader` treats operator-owned env
     keys as authoritative).
  4. ``resolve_pull(selected)`` — return the de-duped UNION of artifact files
     the downloader must provision, so the caller can fold it into the existing
     model-download step additively without disturbing the flat path.

If the profile has no ``composition`` key this function is a strict no-op:
``os.environ`` is untouched, no registry is loaded, the validator never runs,
and an empty file list is returned.
