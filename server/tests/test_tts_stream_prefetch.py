"""Regression tests for the /tts/stream sentence prefetch window.

The window decides when sentence i+1 may be handed to the TTS executor while
sentence i is still draining. It was written as

    (next_to_submit - current_idx) < prefetch_max

which is off by one: sentences 0..next_to_submit-1 are already submitted, so
the count in flight *ahead* of the current one is next_to_submit-1-current_idx.
With prefetch_max=1 -- the value on every RK device, where the TTS executor has
a single worker -- the old form evaluated 1 < 1 and never submitted anything
after sentence 0. The drain loop then awaited a queue that nothing would ever
fill and /tts/stream deadlocked on *any* multi-sentence input, holding the
single session slot until the client timed out.

Measured on radxa before the fix: "Hello there. How are you?" (two short
sentences, 1.4 s of audio) hung after emitting only sentence 0.
