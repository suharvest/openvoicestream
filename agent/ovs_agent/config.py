    Root cause this guards against (2026-05-31): production injects flags via

    ``OVS_AGENT_SERVER_LOOP="1"`` arrives in ``os.environ`` as the 3-char

    quotes in place, so it never matched ``"1"`` and silently fell through to
    False, disabling server-loop in prod while isolated ``-e FLAG=1`` runs
    (no quotes) passed. Peeling the quote pair makes ``"1"`` / ``'1'`` /
    ``" 1 "`` / ``1`` all normalize to ``1``.

    Only a *matched* outer pair is stripped (one level), and only after
