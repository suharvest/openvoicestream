"""WakeSource plugin ABC for pipeline_mode = wake_word / push_to_talk.

A WakeSource is a Plugin that listens to some external signal (HTTP
endpoint, MQTT topic, GPIO edge, ONNX keyword spotter, …) and calls
``self.app.wake(source=self.name)`` when the wake condition is met.

Subclasses override start() to begin listening and stop() to tear down.
The base class is intentionally minimal — wake fan-out and state
gating live in BaseApp.wake() / BaseApp.sleep().
